# 🧐 Project philosophy

> The Airbnb app lets you chat with your Host, receive up-to-the-minute information about your booking, and make the most of your trip by getting the best info on everything local that only expert Hosts would know.

> It is a travel app which provides a platform for apartment rental opportunities all over the world. Airbnb serves as a tempting marketplace for owners of property and people seeking short-term accommodation.
